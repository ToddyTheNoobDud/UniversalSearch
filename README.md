<h1 align="center"> UniversalSearch</h1>
          An discord bot that searchs universally, Based on RileCraft's discord bot template

<h1 align="center"> Starting With The Handler / other stuff </h1>
This Bot is oficially made from scratch but based on RileCraft's discord bot template [https://github.com/RileCraft/DiscordBot-Template] |
Mostly changes made on the handler will be bug fixes, Optimizations, Faster code, etc... Everyone can use the code! no need to ask for permission, you can use it for free

<h1 align="center"> What will be ideia? </h1>

The bot is yet in alpha / beta and has no commands, my main ideia is to create a bot that can search everything inside discord (user info, stuff from google, etc..)
Will probaly have support for some websites like roblox (others bot have the same function so why not)

<h1 align="center"> Support? </h1>
Made in typescript, bugs fixed on nodejs, so i can say it has support for typescript and nodejs (?)
